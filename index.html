                I know that you‚Äôre next<br>
                soon it‚Äôll be my turn<br>
                forgetting about the harm you did<br><br>

                this is what you wanted<br>
                this is what you made<br>
                family of two all by yourselves<br><br>

                twisting my words<br>
                my whole life<br>
                leaving behind another broken generation<br><br>

                memory care<br>
                scared as hell<br>
                push us away just to save yourself<br><br>

                hospital phone by your side<br>
                you call and call again each night<br>
                you stay just the same every time<br>
                you‚Äôre just a replica now

                It‚Äôs a cold cold america x2<br><br>

                the souls have no where to roam<br>
                my body has no room to grow<br><br>

                disappear into the lake<br>
                my flesh will rot<br>
                I become bone<br><br>

                so Ill slowly decompose<br>
                down here not coming home<br><br>

                nothin left for you to find<br>
                an empty shell<br>
                a hollow tree<br><br>

                it‚Äôs a cold cold america x2<br><br>

                the souls have no where to roam<br>
                my body has no room to grow<br>
                I hope to find a little peace<br>
                my mind is not what it used to be

                not all of this is mine to share<br>
                your memories are mine to bare<br>
                Im sorry this is how it is<br>
                nothing much left to give<br><br>

                don‚Äôt believe in your god no more<br>
                idont know if I did before<br>
                he let me down too many times<br>
                now all I have are my<br>
                stories I‚Äôll never know<br>
                oh please let go<br><br>

                I suppose I didn‚Äôt even know<br>
                who you were long before you got old<br>
                am I saying empty words<br>
                just to make yourself feel worse<br><br>

                when its your time you decide<br>
                well be right here ill be your guide<br>
                this is what I would‚Äôve said<br>
                had we been there before you dead<br>
                stories well never know<br>
                oh please don‚Äôt go<br><br>

                overwhelming feeling now<br>
                getting harder to figure it out<br>
                she said to me don‚Äôt worry baby<br>
                you haven‚Äôt been sleeping lately<br><br>

                used to lie wide awake at night<br>
                wondering what it might be like<br>
                to lose all your memories<br>
                would I be scared or would I be free<br>
                stories you‚Äôll never know<br>
                oh please just go

                give the world authenticity thru something shitty,<br>
                a little bit of nothingness just to hide it<br><br>

                harder cut into interlude<br>
                slightly louder opera<br>
                slightly less warble fx on acoustic guitars<br>
                less overall fx on very last gtr chord<br>
                more background vox, still slightly increasing every verse<br>
                less stereo more mono drums ? maybe just a tad<br>
                cut out last handful (3?) drum hits (hard cut end on beat 4)<br><br>

                <b>Chaos / Crisis / Control</b><br><br>

                music as spirituality<br>
                similarity to ‚Äúcrystal girlies‚Äù<br><br>

                <b>Psychonautica</b><br><br>

                alleviate suffering<br>
                pain is inevitable, suffering is ‚Äúoptional‚Äù<br><br>

                you‚Äôve got the freedom of a heron now

                fucky fracture vox?<br><br>

                toms @ 3:40 ü§®<br><br>

                sounds like a woman screaming in the background and it‚Äôs awesome<br>
                overall way too loud<br>
                thin out vox<br>
                less ambient swell at end<br>
                music as therapy<br><br>

                music becomes more than therapeutic.<br>
                it‚Äôs allowed me to be obsessively controlling, mentally stable, storyteller.<br><br>

                everything is a copy, regurgitation.

                and then I spent more time thinking about how I wish it happened different.<br><br>

                this isn‚Äôt a confession but it could be the truth.<br><br>

                anyone can create a story,<br>
                rewriting memories is easy, it‚Äôs a function of memory.
